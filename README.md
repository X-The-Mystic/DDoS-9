# DDoS-9
This is a minor improvement upon the previous attack code, being able to target multiple IPv4 addresses.

# How to use:
Open a terminal and type
`git clone https://github.com/X-The-Mystic/DDoS-9`.
Then, type 
`cd DDoS-9`.
Finally, to run the code, type 
`python3 main.py`.

# Some Tips:
Before launching the attack, use the command 
`nmap -Pn (port no.) (IPv4 address)`.
While attack is in progress, use a tool such as Wireshark to view the packets.
